# ChatApp

This Project is a simple chat-bot, all you need to configure is the `config.ts`
with the relevant url and types for request and response
as well as the titles and tab icon.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
